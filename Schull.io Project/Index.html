                            <p> The best decision I made in 2021 was enrolling in the Linux Boot Camp organized by
                                Schull.io.
                                Learning has never been this seamless and awesome.
                                With little knowledge in cloud engineering I have earned a job as a DevOps Engineer
                                through the booth camp.
                                This means a lot to me and my career journey. </p>

                                gave me the leg up that I needed to advance in my career.
                                After the training, I got interviewed by one of the fintech companies which landed me a
